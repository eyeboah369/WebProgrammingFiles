I have been studying computers and coding since my high school senior year. I started in web development with simple HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 
When, I arrived in college I learned Java and about object oriented programming and how languages like Java work and function. Taking the 
required cs courses here I learned about how to use data structures and how to organize my code to create simple programs in Java. Then after my 
first year I was able to intern doing technical marketing which taught me about hardware and how to program hardware in C++ native code 
(very basic coding). The next summer i had the opportunity to intern doing application security engineering where i did static and dynamic code 
analysis. I learned how to write small scripts in python as well and do other penetration testing skills. Then this year I am transitioning more 
to picking up a more distinct development stack with React, Python and fundamentally understanding JavaScript.

This course will help me to hopefully help me to be able to better understand JavaScript through languages like Vue and further studying 
of libraries like React. This class will help me to solidify these skills and hopefully be able to bolder my tech stack and become more 
efficient with using GitHub as well as learning how to use Node js as well. This will help me to be able to learn about how to work with 
enterprise tools and software to be able to better prepare myself to the real world work of software engineers.
